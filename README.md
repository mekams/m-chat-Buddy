# m-Chat Buddy

## Introduction

we create a full Realtime Chat Application with Social Auth and dedicated chat APIs/sockets.

You will learn how to build a react chat app using [https://chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io)

Firebase and Chat Engine are greats tools to setup apps fast and easily - great to learn with!

### Bonus - E-mail notifications

If you want to upgrade this chat application even further than what is shown in the video, you can add e-mail notifications. More info on https://chatengine.io/docs/email_notifications.
